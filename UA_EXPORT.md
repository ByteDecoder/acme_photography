Until July 1, 2023, you can continue to use and collect new data in your Universal Analytics properties. Some properties will continue to process data for a short period after this as we stage the shutdown of Universal Analytics.

After July 1, 2023, you'll be able to access your previously processed data in your Universal Analytics property for at least six months. We know your data is important to you, and we strongly encourage you to export your historical reports during this time.

In the coming months, we'll provide a future date for when existing Universal Analytics properties will no longer be available. After this future date, you'll no longer be able to see your Universal Analytics reports in the Analytics interface or access your Universal Analytics data via the API.
